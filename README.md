## ðŸ”¨ How We Built it

We built it during MongoDB Hackathon.
we faced many trouble while building this project. we have worked on UI/UX and also on backend.
We have used [Material-UI](https://mui.com/getting-started/usage/) for UI/UX.

### ðŸ’ª Challenges We Are Ran Into

We faced UI/UX troubles due to lack to time.
We also faced many troubles in backend development in payment integration and database structure, but finally we have managed to get it done by using mongodb for database and stripe for payment gateway.
